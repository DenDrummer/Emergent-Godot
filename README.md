# Emergent-Godot

## About the project
Another attempt to make my dream game. But this time using Godot.  
I only work on this during my free time and when I feel like it, so progress will be slow.  

## Discord
If you wish to contribute and/or know more, feel free to contact me in [the Discord](https://discord.gg/UbWJNJj).  


## Gource
This repository has `ShowGource.bat`, a simple batch script which calls [Gource](https://gource.io) with some basic settings.  
To run this you will need to have the repository on a computer/laptop that has gource installed and that can run batch scripts.
